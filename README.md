# How is made

This project is made only with the tkinter library using the labels of the buttons themselves to detect if when pressing the "Check win" button there are in all possible positions of the game a series of X or O.

For the turn system a variable is used which according to the number it has belongs to an X or O so when the player clicks on some of the game boxes he first observes if it is free using the same method to detect if the move is possible and if the turn is for the X or the O.
